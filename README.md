# Smart-Attendance-System-and-Deployment-in-Aws

This repository hosts the code and resources for a comprehensive course on building a complete attendance system using face recognition technology. The course covers the principles of face recognition, image processing, and machine learning algorithms necessary for developing an accurate and reliable attendance system. Utilizing Python programming language and various libraries such as OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Insightface, and Redis, participants will learn to create a fully functional attendance system from scratch.

## Course Content
- **Introduction:** Overview of face recognition technology and its applications in attendance systems.
- **Image Processing:** Fundamental techniques for image filtering, enhancement, and preprocessing.
- **Feature Extraction:** Methods for extracting meaningful facial features and reducing dimensionality.
- **Face Detection and Recognition:** Understanding popular algorithms and their implementation.
- **Machine Learning:** Application of machine learning algorithms for training face recognition models.
- **Building Attendance System:** Step-by-step guidance on integrating face recognition into an attendance system.
